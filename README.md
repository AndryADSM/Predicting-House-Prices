🏘️ Worked on the Kaggle competition "[House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)" where I successfully predicted the sale price of 1459 houses from a dataset of 1460 records of 79 features using Python 🐍.

🔎 Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), looking deep for missing values, distributions, counts, correlations and more with a lot of use of pandas, matplotlib and seaborn.

📊 Created a "Feature Analyzer", really helpful for EDA, which gives relevant information and plots to quickly get useful insights about a certain feature, categorical or numerical, taking advantage of matplotlib and seaborn.

🧹 Used pandas, numpy and sklearn for cleaning and preprocessing, changing data types, ordinal encoding, dummies, lots of feature engineering 🛠️ and more.

🤖 Tested different models, including several from sklearn, like RandomForestRegressor and GradientBoostingRegressor optimizing with GridSearchCV, concluded with CatBoostRegressor as the best model.

🧾 Evaluated performance with a custom scorer, RMSLE (root-mean-squared-log-error), and got 0.12236, which is as high as top 10% of competitors 🏆.
