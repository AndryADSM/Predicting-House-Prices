🏘️ Worked with the **Kaggle competition** "[House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)" where I **predicted** the sale price of 1459 houses using a dataset of 1460 houses with 79 features using 🐍 **Python**.​

📊 Created a "**Feature Analyzer**" that gives relevant information and plots to quickly get **useful insights** about a certain feature, categorical or numerical, taking advantage of **matplotlib** and **seaborn**. 

🧹 Used **pandas**, **numpy** and **sklearn** for cleaning and **preprocessing**, missing values, changed data types, ordinal encoding, 🛠️ **feature engineering**, dummies and more.​

🤖 Tested different models, including several from **sklearn**, concluded with CatBoostRegressor as a model.​

🧾 Evaluated performance with RMSLE (root-mean-squared-log-error) and got 0.12236, which is as high as 🏆 **top 10%** of competitors.
